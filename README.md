# Dotfiles

Nothing special, just my dotfiles. These should work across GNU/Linux and MacOS.

## Installation

You can either use curl or manually clone this repo and run the install script `install.sh`

### Install Script

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KaBankz/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaBankz/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh

You can even go one step further and manually install all the packages and stow all the folders if you don't want to use the install script.
